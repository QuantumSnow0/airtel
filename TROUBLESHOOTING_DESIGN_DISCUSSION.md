# Troubleshooting Page Design Discussion

- 6 main problem categories with solutions
- "Still Need Help" section with contact info
- Dark theme with gold/yellow accents

## Discussion Points

### 1. Layout & Structure
**Current:** Vertical list of problem categories, each in a card

**Questions:**
- Should we use tabs or accordions to organize categories?

- Do we want a sidebar navigation for quick category jumping?
- Should problems be collapsible/expandable to reduce scrolling?

**Ideas:**
- [ ] Tabbed interface (Signal Issues | Speed Issues | WiFi Issues | etc.)
- [ ] Accordion-style (click to expand each category)
- [ ] Search bar to filter problems
- [ ] Sidebar with category links
- [ ] Keep current vertical layout but improve it

### 2. Visual Design Elements

**Current:** Icons, colored borders, numbered solutions

**Questions:**
- Should we add more visual elements (diagrams, illustrations)?

**Ideas:**
