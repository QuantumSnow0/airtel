## 3. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

**Why we need this:** Technical specs help customers make informed decisions and show the product's capabilities. We'll create a "Specifications" section with this information.

### Speed & Performance
- **What are the maximum download speeds?** (Mbps = Megabits per second)
  - *Explanation: Download speed is how fast you can receive data (streaming, downloading files). Example: 100 Mbps means you can download a movie in a few minutes. Higher is better.*
  
- **What are the maximum upload speeds?** (Mbps)
  - *Explanation: Upload speed is how fast you can send data (video calls, uploading photos). Important for video calls and working from home.*
  
- **What are typical/realistic speeds users can expect?**
  - *Explanation: Maximum speeds are ideal conditions. Real-world speeds are usually lower. We want to set realistic expectations so customers aren't disappointed.*
  
- **Does speed vary by location or signal strength?**
  - *Explanation: If yes, we'll explain that speeds depend on how strong the cell tower signal is in their area. This manages expectations.*

### Coverage & Range
- **What is the coverage area/range?** (indoor/outdoor)
  - *Explanation: How far does the WiFi signal reach? Can it cover a whole house? Multiple rooms? We'll show this visually if possible.*
  
- **How many square meters/feet can it cover?**
  - *Explanation: Concrete numbers help customers know if it's right for their space. Example: "Covers up to 200 square meters" helps them visualize.*
  
- **Does it work better indoors or outdoors?**
  - *Explanation: Some devices are designed for outdoor installation to catch better signals, then distribute WiFi indoors. We need to know the intended use.*
  
- **What affects the coverage range?**
  - *Explanation: Walls, distance, interference from other devices can reduce range. We'll include tips for best coverage.*

### Device Capacity
- **How many devices can connect simultaneously?**
  - *Explanation: Modern homes have many devices (phones, laptops, tablets, smart TVs, etc.). Customers need to know if it can handle all their devices.*
  
- **Is there a recommended maximum number of devices?**
  - *Explanation: Even if it can handle 50 devices, performance might be better with 20. We want to give practical guidance.*
  
- **Does performance degrade with more connected devices?**
  - *Explanation: If yes, we'll explain that more devices share the available speed, so each device gets less. This is normal but good to explain.*

### Power Requirements
- **What power source does it use?** (AC adapter, PoE, battery, etc.)
  - *Explanation: AC adapter = plugs into wall socket. PoE = Power over Ethernet (power through network cable). Battery = portable. Customers need to know installation requirements.*
  
- **What is the power consumption?** (watts)
  - *Explanation: How much electricity it uses. Important for customers concerned about electricity bills. Lower is better.*
  
- **Does it require special electrical setup?**
  - *Explanation: Does it need a special outlet? Professional electrician? Or just plug into any wall socket?*

### Physical Specifications
- **What are the dimensions?** (length x width x height in cm/inches)
  - *Explanation: Size matters for installation. Customers need to know if it will fit where they want to install it. We'll show this visually.*
  
- **What is the weight?** (kg/lbs)
  - *Explanation: Important for mounting. Heavy devices need stronger mounting hardware.*
  
- **What materials is it made from?**
  - *Explanation: Plastic, metal, weather-resistant materials? This relates to durability and weather resistance.*
  
- **What colors/finish options are available?**
  - *Explanation: Some customers care about appearance, especially if it's visible in their home/office.*

### Network & Connectivity
- **What network bands does it support?** (4G, 5G, specific frequencies)
  - *Explanation: 4G = current standard, 5G = newer, faster. Some areas only have 4G. We need to know compatibility. Frequencies (like 700MHz, 2600MHz) are technical but important for compatibility.*
  
- **Does it support WiFi? If yes, what WiFi standards?** (WiFi 5, WiFi 6, etc.)
  - *Explanation: WiFi 5 (802.11ac) = older but common. WiFi 6 (802.11ax) = newer, faster, better for many devices. This affects what devices can connect and speeds.*
  
- **What ports/connections does it have?** (Ethernet, USB, etc.)
  - *Explanation: Ethernet ports = wired connections (more stable). USB = for external devices. Customers might want to connect computers via cable for better speed.*
  
- **Does it require a SIM card? What type?**
  - *Explanation: Some devices need a SIM card (like a phone) to connect to the network. Size matters: nano-SIM, micro-SIM, etc. Customers need to know if they need to get a SIM card.*

### Signal Technology
- **How does the signal amplification work?** (Technical explanation)
  - *Explanation: This is the "how it works" explanation. Does it have an antenna that catches weak signals and amplifies them? We'll simplify this for customers but need the technical details.*
  
- **What is the gain/amplification level?** (dB = decibels)
  - *Explanation: This measures how much the signal is boosted. Higher dB = stronger boost. Example: 20dB gain means the signal is 100 times stronger. Technical but shows capability.*
  
- **Does it have directional or omnidirectional antenna?**
  - *Explanation: Directional = points in one direction (like a satellite dish) - better signal but must point at tower. Omnidirectional = receives from all directions - easier setup but slightly weaker. This affects installation.*
