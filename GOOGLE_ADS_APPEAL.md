- We forward qualified leads to Airtel Networks Kenya Limited for service processing and installation
- All actual service delivery, billing, and support are handled directly by Airtel Networks Kenya Limited

## Additional Information for Appeal

### Business Registration Details:

- **Enterprise Name:** WAM APPLICATIONS
- **Agent Contact:** 0789 457 580
- **Operating as:** Authorized Airtel Kenya Agent

### Clarification on Trademark Usage:

We understand that "Airtel" is a registered trademark of Airtel Networks Kenya Limited. We use the Airtel name and branding with proper authorization as an authorized agent. Our website includes clear disclaimers stating:

- "Airtel and the Airtel logo are trademarks of Airtel Networks Kenya Limited"
- "This website is operated by an authorized Airtel Kenya agent"
- "Services are provided by Airtel Networks Kenya Limited"

### Our Compliance Measures:

1. **Clear Agent Disclosure:** Our website footer and all pages clearly state we are an authorized agent, not Airtel itself
2. **Transparent Business Model:** Terms of Service and Privacy Policy clearly explain our role as a lead generation intermediary
3. **Proper Attribution:** All Airtel trademarks are properly attributed with links to Airtel's official website
4. **Contact Information:** We provide both our agent contact and Airtel's official customer care information
5. **No Misleading Claims:** We do not claim to be Airtel or represent ourselves as the official company

### Authorization Documentation:

We have authorization documentation from Airtel Networks Kenya Limited that confirms our status as an authorized agent. This documentation can be provided for Google's review upon request.

### Multiple Google Ads Accounts:

We acknowledge that we created a second Google Ads account after the initial suspension. This was done in error - we believed that after making compliance improvements to our website (adding footer, privacy policy, terms of service), we could start fresh. We now understand that this was not the correct approach and that we should have appealed the original suspension instead.

We are committed to:

- Using only one Google Ads account going forward
- Properly appealing any policy violations rather than creating new accounts
- Following Google's policies and procedures

We request that Google review our original suspended account and consider reinstating it based on our compliance improvements and legitimate business model. We are willing to close the second account if required.

### Request for Review:

We respectfully request that Google review our account suspension. We believe our business model is legitimate, we are properly authorized, and we have taken steps to ensure full compliance with Google's advertising policies. We acknowledge our mistake in creating a second account and are committed to maintaining transparency and compliance in all our advertising activities going forward.
