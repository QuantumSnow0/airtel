# Device-Specific Questions for Better Troubleshooting Guide

## Questions About the Device

### Physical Device Information
1. **LED Indicators**
   - What LED lights does the device have? (Power, Signal, WiFi, etc.) 
   answer: The router has an led at the center button powers red /router/router-red-light.jpeg 
   then changes to a nice gradient light /router/router-red-light.jpeg 
   it stays in this state for a while before switching to blue /router/router-blue-light.jpeg which rapidly switches to green /router/router-green-light.jpeg hence the device has powered on this however does not indicate good connection it only means the router is on and hence its ssid is visible the connection is indicated by the antenna /router/antenna.png when it boots the power led lights on /router/antenna-power-led.png then the the rest follows /router/antenna-all-led.png 
   - What do different LED colors mean? (Green = good, Red = problem, etc.)
   answer: there are total of 5 leds on the antenna /router/antenna.png but the one to keep a keen on is the signal led /router/antenna-signal-led.png green is what you want /router/antenna-green-signal.png orange is good but not better /router/antenna-orange-signal.png avoid red at all cost /router/antenna-red-signal.png 
   - What do blinking vs solid LEDs indicate?
   answer: skip for now
   - *Why: Users can check LED status to diagnose issues quickly*

2. **Buttons & Controls**
   - What buttons/switches are on the device?
   answer: the router has a center button /router/router-button.png used to power on the router but it basically powers it self on once it receives power the antenna has no external buttons
   - What does each button do? (Reset, Power, WPS, etc.)
   answer: the router push button is used for booting already explained above
   - How do you perform a factory reset? (Hold button for X seconds?)
   Answer: to perform a factory reset is tricky but possible since the factory reset button is on the antenna which is normally placed outside, you open the small screws at the bottom of the antenna /router/antenna-bottom-screws.png once open you will see a small reset dot /router/antenna-reset-button.png carefully press with a small pin or needle untill the side leds start blinking release and the reboot cycle will start and the device will reset to the default ssid and password 
   - *Why: Users need to know how to interact with the device*

3. **Ports & Connections**
   - What ports are on the device? (Ethernet, USB, Power, SIM slot, etc.)
   answer: /router/router-ports.png There is one W/LAN1 /router/router-wlan-port.png connect the ethernet cable here from the antenna to the the router there are 3 addittional LANS for devices and one usb 
   - Where is the SIM card slot located?
   answer: The sim card slot is located at the bottom of the antenna you must first open the two screws /router/antenna-bottom-screws.png to access the sim card slot /router/antenna-sim-slot.png
   - How do you properly insert/remove the SIM card?
   answer: with the antenna facing upside down /router/antenna-upside-down.png and the sim card facing as shown airtel-5g-sim.png insert into the sim card slot router/antenna-sim-slot.png
   - *Why: Connection issues often relate to physical connections*

4. **Device Labels/Stickers**
   - What information is on the device label? (Default WiFi password, IP address, etc.)'
 answer: device information is behind the router /router/router-back-details.png including both the 2.4G SSID and 5G SSID and both there passwords also the ip address and the default admin user and password and the input voltage and the mac and serial number of the device
   - Where is the label located?
answer: at the back of the router router /router/router-back-details.png
   - What's the default admin password/username?
   User: admin
   Password: admin
   - *Why: Users often need default credentials*

### Device Behavior & Status

7. **Signal Strength Indicators**
   - How does the device show signal strength? (LED bars, colors, etc.)
   - What signal strength is considered good/fair/poor?
   - How do users check current signal strength?
   - *Why: Signal strength is the #1 troubleshooting factor*

### Device Settings & Configuration
