# 3D Model Conversion Guide: OBJ → GLTF/GLB

Your current model is **20.81 MB** as OBJ. Converting to GLTF/GLB will:
- ✅ Reduce file size by 5-10x (estimated: 2-4 MB)
- ✅ Faster loading on mobile devices
- ✅ Better compression
- ✅ Single file (GLB) with texture embedded

---

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDED: Online Converter (Easiest - 5 minutes)**

### Step 1: Use Aspose 3D Converter
1. Go to: **https://products.aspose.app/3d/conversion/obj-to-gltf**
2. Or search: "OBJ to GLTF converter online"

### Step 2: Upload Files
You need to upload **THREE files** together:
- ✅ `3DModel.obj` (the 3D model)
- ✅ `3DModel.mtl` (material file)
- ✅ `3DModel.jpg` (texture image)

**Important:** Some converters require you to zip all 3 files together:
- Create a ZIP containing: `3DModel.obj`, `3DModel.mtl`, `3DModel.jpg`
- Upload the ZIP file

### Step 3: Choose Output Format
- **GLB** (recommended) - Single file, texture embedded, smaller size
- **GLTF** - Two files (.gltf + .bin), texture separate

### Step 4: Download and Replace
1. Download the converted file
2. Save as `3DModel.glb` (or `3DModel.gltf`)
3. Place in `/public/model/` folder

---

## 🔧 **Option 2: Blender (If You Have It)**

If you have Blender installed:

### Step 1: Import OBJ
1. Open Blender
2. File → Import → Wavefront (.obj)
3. Navigate to `/public/model/`
4. Select `3DModel.obj`
   - Blender should auto-load `3DModel.mtl` and `3DModel.jpg`

### Step 2: Verify Model
- Check if texture is applied correctly
- Check the scale (might need to adjust)

### Step 3: Export to GLTF/GLB
1. File → Export → glTF 2.0 (.glb/.gltf)
2. In export options:
   - **Format:** GLB (for single file) or GLTF Separate
   - **Transform:** Keep defaults
   - **Geometry:** Keep all checked
   - **Animation:** Uncheck (if not needed)
   - **Include:** Check "Materials" and "Images"
3. Save to `/public/model/3DModel.glb`

## 💻 **Option 3: Command Line (Advanced)**

### Using `obj2gltf` Tool

1. **Install Node.js tool globally:**
```bash
npm install -g obj2gltf
```

2. **Convert the file:**
```bash
cd lead-capture/public/model
obj2gltf -i 3DModel.obj -o 3DModel.glb
```

**Note:** This requires all files (OBJ, MTL, JPG) to be in the same directory.

### Alternative: `gltf-pipeline` (Better Compression)

1. **Install:**
```bash
npm install -g gltf-pipeline
```

2. **First convert OBJ to GLTF using Blender or online tool, then optimize:**
```bash
gltf-pipeline -i 3DModel.gltf -o 3DModel.glb --draco.compressionLevel 10
```

## 📊 **Expected Results**

| Format | File Size | Loading Speed | Mobile-Friendly |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| OBJ (current) | ~21 MB | Slow ❌ | Poor ❌ |
| GLTF | ~3-5 MB | Fast ✅ | Good ✅ |
| GLB (recommended) | ~2-4 MB | Very Fast ✅✅ | Excellent ✅✅ |

---

## ✅ **After Conversion**

1. **Keep the original OBJ files** (backup) or move to a backup folder
2. **Rename converted file** to `3DModel.glb` in `/public/model/`
3. **Test the model** in your browser using React Three Fiber
4. **Optimize further** if needed (reduce texture resolution, simplify geometry)

---

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### Issue: Texture not showing after conversion
- **Solution:** Make sure MTL and JPG files are in the same folder during conversion
- Try GLB format (texture embedded) instead of GLTF

### Issue: Model too large even after conversion
- **Solution:** Reduce texture image size (compress JPG)
- Use Blender to reduce polygon count
- Use `gltf-pipeline` with Draco compression

### Issue: Colors look different
- **Solution:** Re-export from original Blender file if possible
- Adjust material settings in the converter

## 🎯 **Recommended Next Steps**

1. ✅ Convert using **Online Converter (Option 1)** - fastest
2. ✅ Download as **GLB format**
3. ✅ Place in `/public/model/3DModel.glb`
4. ✅ Then proceed with React Three Fiber setup

**Once converted, let me know and I'll help you integrate it into your mobile-test page!** 🚀
